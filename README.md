# 🚗 **Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ) Vehicle Entries Analysis** 📊

## 📝 **Group G: Private Repository for QMSS G5063**

### **Project Overview**:
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing **vehicle entries** into the **Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ)** in Manhattan, New York, as part of the newly implemented **congestion pricing policy**. We will explore traffic flow patterns, vehicle categories, and peak hours through interactive dashboards and visualizations.

- **Zisu Xia**: yc4460@columbia.edu  
- **Jenna Cheng**: zx2503@columbia.edu  
- **Boyan Sun**: bs3579@columbia.edu  

Guided by **Professor Thomas Brambor**.

### **📊 Dataset**:
The dataset is publicly available from the **New York State Open Data Portal** and contains **vehicle entries data** related to tolling and traffic in the **Congestion Relief Zone** (CRZ) of Manhattan.  
Access the dataset here: [MTA Congestion Relief Zone Vehicle Entries Dataset](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Congestion-Relief-Zone-Vehicle-Entries-Beginni/t6yz-b64h/about_data).

### **🛠️ What We Will Do**:
- **Data Exploration & Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Build a dashboard to visualize traffic patterns by vehicle category, time of day, and CRZ vs. Excluded Roadway entries.
- **Insightful Analysis**: Analyze how congestion pricing is impacting traffic in the CRZ and surrounding roadways.

### **📈 Project Significance**:
- **Traffic Management**: The analysis will provide insights into how **congestion pricing** is influencing traffic flow patterns.
- **Policy Evaluation**: This project will help evaluate the effectiveness of **congestion pricing** in reducing traffic in critical areas of Manhattan.
- **Public Awareness**: Share visualized data for public awareness, policy decisions, and future urban planning.

### **🌐 Interactive Visualization Website**:
- The **interactive dashboard** for exploring CRZ entries data is hosted on **Streamlit**.
