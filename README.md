# **🚗Group G: Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ) Vehicle Entries Analysis** 📊

### **Project Overview**:
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing **vehicle entries** into the **Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ)** in Manhattan, New York, as part of the newly implemented **congestion pricing policy**. We will explore traffic flow patterns, vehicle categories, and peak hours through interactive dashboards and visualizations. 

### **📚 Team Members**:  
- **Zisu Xia**: yc4460@columbia.edu  
- **Jenna Cheng**: zx2503@columbia.edu  
- **Boyan Sun**: bs3579@columbia.edu  

Guided by **Professor Thomas Brambor**.

### **📊 Dataset**:
The dataset is publicly available from the **New York State Open Data Portal** and contains **vehicle entries data** related to tolling and traffic in the **Congestion Relief Zone** (CRZ) of Manhattan.  
Access the dataset here: [MTA Congestion Relief Zone Vehicle Entries Dataset](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Congestion-Relief-Zone-Vehicle-Entries-Beginni/t6yz-b64h/about_data).

#### **Dataset Overview**:
The dataset provides **daily traffic volumes**, including **vehicle entries** to **CRZ** and **Excluded Roadways** in Manhattan. The data includes details on **vehicle type**, **crossing points**, and **hourly entries**. It spans a range of **vehicle classes** such as cars, buses, trucks, and taxis.

Here is a preview of the dataset:
Toll Date    | Toll Hour  | Detection Group | Vehicle Class | CRZ Entries | Excluded Roadway Entries
------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ------------- | ----------- | -----------------------
2025-01-05  | 00:00      | Brooklyn Bridge | Class 1       | 1500        | 300
2025-01-05  | 01:00      | Manhattan Bridge| Class 2       | 1200        | 250
2025-01-05  | 02:00      | Queensboro Bridge| Class 3      | 800         | 150
2025-01-06  | 00:00      | Williamsburg Bridge | Class 4    | 1400        | 200
2025-01-06  | 01:00      | Lincoln Tunnel  | Class 5       | 1300        | 180
...|  |  |  |  | 

### **🛠️ What We Will Do**:
- **Data Exploration & Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Build a dashboard to visualize traffic patterns by vehicle category, time of day, and CRZ vs. Excluded Roadway entries.
- **Insightful Analysis**: Analyze how congestion pricing is impacting traffic in the CRZ and surrounding roadways.

### **📈 Project Significance**:
- **Traffic Management**: The analysis will provide insights into how **congestion pricing** is influencing traffic flow patterns.
- **Policy Evaluation**: This project will help evaluate the effectiveness of **congestion pricing** in reducing traffic in critical areas of Manhattan.
- **Public Awareness**: Share visualized data for public awareness, policy decisions, and future urban planning.
